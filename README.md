# Hyperparameter Tuning and CIFAR-10

### **What is the purpose of this work?**

<br>
This repository, has as a personal goal to familiarize myself with deep learning, and to help disseminate what I have learned regarding the same topic.

In addition, what one should take away after reading this paper is the following:

-   Familiarize oneself with the models.
-   Familiarize yourself with hyper-parameters and building blocks of neural networks
-   Learning how to build your own neural networks
-   A well-formed foundation on neural networks

# What am I going to do in this work?

I decided to do this work in an "activity" format, as I think it better reflects the "Why? I do such and such a thing.

First I am going to perform my analysis with a dataset of a sinusoidal function, then in activity 6, I will use the CIFAR 10 dataset and in activity 7 a bees and ants dataset, the latter being image datasets.

## Files:

-   [Part1](): Contains activities: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.
-   [Part2](): Contains activities: 5 and 7.

### **DISCLAIMER:** All comments are in spanish in the notebook files

### Activities:

1. Evaluate the use of regularization. Evaluate the use of cost function L1. Do a grid search of hyper-parameters (`learning_rate`, `weight_decay`, `epochs`). [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part1.ipynb)

2. Implement and train a two-layer feedforward network model like the second one in the figure. Experiment with different numbers of nodes in the hidden layer. Repeat the learning rate search from the previous point. [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part1.ipynb)

3. With this neural network, experiment with different activation functions, such as hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) or ReLU (search for them, for example, in the Pytorch documentation). [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part1.ipynb)

4. Evaluate how the convergence of this neural network changes with different values of batch size and learning rate. [Go to Activity]()

5. Starting from the version with mini-batches, modify the training loop so that, without modifying the iteration over the DataLoader, it implements standard gradient descent (_vanilla_) (update using the gradient over the cumulative cost function, after traversing the whole dataset). [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part2.ipynb)

6. Seek to improve as much as possible the hit rate for all CIFAR-10 classes. Ex: data augmentation, different hyper-parameters, different architecture, different optimizer, or whatever you can think of. [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part1.ipynb)

7. Use a pre-trained network and complete some transfer learning task(s) for the example domain (classify ants and bees), or for some image domain of your interest [Go to Activity](https://github.com/francofgp/Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-CIFAR-10/blob/main/Part2.ipynb)

**Python 3.7 required**

Use the package manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html) to install the same virtual environment that I used, this command will create a new virtual environment with the same libraries that I used:

```bash
conda env create -f my_environment.yml
```
